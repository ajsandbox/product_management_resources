# Methods to evaluate a design 

A look at the various design principles. Some of objective, some are subjective. 

### Dieter Ram's 10 design principles

* **Good design is innovative** : The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.
* **Good design makes a product useful** : A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.
* **Good design is aesthetic** : The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
* **Good design makes a product understandable** : It clarifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
* **Good design is unobtrusive** : Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the users self-expression.
* **Good design is honest** : It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
* **Good design is long-lasting** : It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in todays throwaway society.
* **Good design is thorough down to the last detail** : Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.
* **Good design is environmentally friendly** : Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.
* **Good design is as little design as possible** : Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.

### Don Norman's Principles of Design (From the design of everyday things)

* **Visibility** : The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. In contrast, when functions are out of sight, it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use.

* **Feedback** : Feedback is about sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.

* **Constraints** : The design concept of constraining refers to determining ways of restricting the kind of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. There are various ways this can be achieved.

* **Mapping** : This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car, power plant, or cockpit. An example of a good mapping between control and effect is the up and down arrows used to represent the up and down movement of the cursor, respectively, on a computer keyboard.

* **Consistency** : This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. In particular, a consistent interface is one that follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects. For example, a consistent operation is using the same input action to highlight any graphical object at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button. Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions to a rule.

* **Affordance** : A term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. For example, a mouse button invites pushing (in so doing acting clicking) by the way it is physically constrained in its plastic shell. At a very simple level, to afford means to give a clue (Norman, 1988). When the affordances of a physical object are perceptually obvious it is easy to know how to interact with it.

Others
* It should be easy for people to undo in case they have accidentally given some input (e.g correct navigation) 
* The present state of the product should be easily decipherable (e.g. being able to show where the person is in navigation, state of an alarm clock, onboarding a customer)
* The 2 click rule : One should be able to get to the final output within 2 click 
* The pain and gain rule : The amount of gain should be quatratic function of the amount of pain
